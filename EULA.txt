6.3 Existing Claims. Brocade has no obligations under this Section if End User was aware of any actual, pending or threatened claims that are the subject of Brocade's indemnity obligation hereunder at the time End User purchased or secured the applicable license for the Software. Brocade's obligation to indemnify End User applies only to final judgments entered in such a suit by a court of competent jurisdiction or proceeding and against settlements arising out of such a claim.

BROCADE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS OR EXPENSES INCURRED WITHOUT ITS PRIOR WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION. THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS STATE THE ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATIONS OF BROCADE AND ITS SUPPLIERS, AND THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF END USER WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT BY THE BROCADE OFFERING OR ANY PART THEREOF OR BY THEIR OPERATION.
7.     Proprietary Rights.

8.     Confidential Information.
8.1 Confidentiality. Confidential Information means any information disclosed by Brocade to End User, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, proprietary information, technical data, trade secrets (other than the Source Code) or know-how (including, without limitation, research, product plans, products, services, customers, markets, works of original authorship, photographs, negatives, digital images, software, computer programs, know-how, ideas, inventions (whether or not patentable), processes, formula, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing or finance documents and other technical, business, financial, customer and product development plans, forecasts, strategies and information), which is designated as “Confidential,” “Proprietary” or some similar designation by Brocade or which the End User knows or has reason to known is regarded as confidential by Brocade ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information may also include information disclosed to Brocade by third parties. End User will at all times keep in confidence all such Confidential Information, and shall not use such Confidential Information without Brocade's written consent except in performance of End User's duties hereunder. End User may not disclose the Confidential Information to any person except its employees to whom it is necessary to disclose the Confidential Information for permissible internal business purposes and who have agreed to receive it under terms at least as restrictive as those specified in the Software Terms. End User's obligation to protect Confidential Information is satisfied if End User utilizes the same control over the Confidential Information as End User employs to avoid disclosure of End User's own confidential and valuable information (but no less than commercially reasonable control). End User will immediately give notice to Brocade of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. End User agrees to assist Brocade in remedying such unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. The foregoing obligations will not apply to the extent End User can demonstrate:
8.1.1 The disclosed Confidential Information was part of the public domain at the time of disclosure;
8.1.2 End User can establish by written evidence that the disclosed Confidential Information was in the possession of the End User at the time of its disclosure by Brocade;
8.1.3 End User received the disclosed Confidential information from a third party without similar restrictions on disclosure and without breach of these Software Terms or any other agreement; or
8.1.4 End User is required to disclose the Confidential Information to a government agency to further the objectives of these Software Terms, such as to obtain permission to distribute the Brocade Offering as permitted hereunder, or in the event a proper court of competent jurisdiction orders its disclosure; provided, however, that End User will use its best efforts to minimize the disclosure of such Confidential information and will consult with and assist Brocade in obtaining a protective order prior to such disclosure.
8.2 Retention Rights. Brocade may use any general learning, skills, or know-how or any information retained in the unaided memory of a person who had access to the End User's Confidential Information for any purpose. Brocade is free to develop products independently and Brocade is not obligated to restrict the future work assignments of people who have had access to End User's Confidential Information or to restrict Brocade product development or plans in any way due to such access. Brocade may use any technical information it derives from providing the Support relating to Service Request resolution, troubleshooting, functionality enhancements and fixes. In the event of an unauthorized use, distribution or disclosure of any Confidential Information, the parties agree that the harmed party will not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, injunctive or other equitable relief may be appropriate to restrain such use, distribution or disclosure, whether threatened or actual. To the extent that Brocade provides End User serial numbers, access codes, entitlement numbers or the license to access Software Services, or Support, End User is responsible for the security and use of such information, including that contained in the documentation therefore. If End User believes any Brocade Confidential Information has been lost, stolen, or misused, End User must immediately notify Brocade and its designated Support or Services contact.

Subject to the provisions of these Supplemental License Terms and payment of applicable fees and other amounts, Brocade grants End User a limited, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable license to use the Software only in object code form by the End User only for its internal purposes for the term of the license purchased. Software must be used by End User only in accordance with the Software documentation and policies provided by Brocade. The license(s) granted herein excludes licenses obtained for evaluation purposes. End User may only use the Software in a manner for which End User has purchased and obtained a valid license. Licenses may be Perpetual, Subscription or Usage based as provided in these Supplemental License Terms and as indicated on End Users invoice and purchase documentation. A Subscription license is non-cancellable and non-refundable.
The Software is licensed on a per instance basis for use on a Licensed Server.  The Brocade Services Directory may be used to generate an instance of vTM.  End User may only use the Software to manage, secure and accelerate application traffic in the manner licensed by End User for that instance. The vTM and vWAF software is licensed is limited by throughput capacity.   Use is limited to one copy of a single vTM or vWAF instance running or used at any time.  End User may generate any quantity of instances of vTM provided that End User’s collective use of such instances at any given time may not exceed the amount of throughput set forth in End User’s applicable purchase documentation and may only include the features End User has specifically licensed.     
The Software may include features or functionality or other software for which End User does not have a right or license to use.  For the avoidance of doubt, End User is only authorized to use the Software including any Software functions or features related thereto that End User has purchased a valid license as specified in End User’s purchase documentation.
End User is responsible for immediately deleting any Software instances which End User does not wish to use or is not licensed to pursuant to the provisions of these Supplemental License Terms or End User will be charged for the use of the Software against End User’s total licensed throughput. 
Transfer of Licenses
End User may (1) transfer the Software from the designated Licensed Server to another designated server that meets the requirements to be a Licensed Server, provided that the new designated server is identified to Brocade prior to or at the time of transfer and, upon transfer, the Software on the original Licensed Server is no longer used and is de-installed using any de-installation instructions provided by Brocade or (2) transfer the designated supported operating system or computing platform for the Software to a different supported operating system or computing platform for such Software, provided that the new supported operating system or computing platform type is identified to Brocade prior to or at the time of transfer and, upon transfer, any copies of the Software instances designated for the original supported operating system or computing platform are no longer used and are either de-installed using any de-installation instructions provided by Brocade or destroyed (at Brocade’s option). Upon transfer of the Software to a new designated server in accordance with the foregoing requirements the new designated server will be deemed a Licensed Server. End User is responsible for working with Brocade support in connection with any such transfer to ensure that the all Software instances are transferred accurately. End User may make one copy of the Software, and any other related software that End User has purchased a license for, solely for backup and/or disaster recovery purposes.
Support & Services
Brocade’s obligations to provide Support or Services with respect to any Software are subject to End User’s advance payment of Brocade’s applicable Support and Services fees. The purchase or renewal of Support for any Software purchased by Customer requires the purchase or renewal of Support for all Software licensed by End User, and Brocade is not obligated to provide Support to End User if the foregoing condition is not met.  If there is a lapse in Support, at Brocade’s sole discretion (a) any subsequent purchase of Support may be deemed purchased retroactive to the later of (i) the date on which any prior Support period concluded or (ii) the date on which the particular Software was purchased, and (b) End User shall pay all applicable Support fees for such lapsed period plus an additional twenty percent (20%) charge on the applicable Support fees for the lapsed Support period, which amounts will be based on the level of Support that End User requests to purchase for such Software.

At Brocade’s sole option, Brocade may invoice End User for any (1) throughput amounts and (2) use of Software functions or features and other related software which exceeds or differ from the scope of End User’s license.
